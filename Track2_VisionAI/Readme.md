# Welcome to Track 2: Building AI Solutions Leveraging Vision AI, Audio, and Video AI for Government  
  
Welcome to Track 2 of our AI journey! In this track, we will delve into the exciting world of Vision AI, Audio AI, and Video AI, specifically tailored for government applications. Our primary tool for this exploration will be the AI Foundry on the Azure portal.  
  
## Overview  
  
In this track, you will:  
- Set up your environment on the Azure portal.  
- Learn how to leverage Vision AI, Audio AI, and Video AI for various applications.  
  
## Setting Up Your Environment  
  
To get started, we would need to set up environment on Azure and will follow the step-by-step process provided in this guide: [Chat with your data using Azure OpenAI models (AI Foundry)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?tabs=keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=ai-foundry-portal).  
  
## High-Level Overview  
  
You will gain a high-level understanding of how to utilize AI technologies in vision, audio, and video processing. This includes setting up integrated vectorization for enhanced search capabilities and applying these tools to real-world government scenarios.
