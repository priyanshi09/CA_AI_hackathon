# CA AI Hackathon for Public Sector

Welcome to the CA AI Hackathon for Public Sector! This hackathon is designed to enhance public services in California by leveraging Microsoft Azure AI technologies. We have three exciting tracks for you to participate in:

## Tracks

### Track 1: GenAI Powered Chatbots for Government
Explore the power of generative AI to create intelligent chatbots that can assist government agencies in providing better services to the public. Learn how to build and deploy chatbots using Azure AI services.

### Track 2: Vision, Audio, and Video AI Solutions for Government
Dive into the world of AI-powered vision, audio, and video technologies. Develop solutions that can help government agencies automate processes, improve security, and enhance public engagement. Utilize Azure AI services to create innovative applications.

### Track 3: AI Agents
Discover the potential of AI agents in transforming government operations. Build multi-agent systems that can perform complex tasks, automate workflows, and improve decision-making. Leverage Azure AI services to create powerful AI agents.

## Getting Started

To get started with the hackathon, You have a few options for setting up this project.

### Local environment

1. Install the required tools:

    - [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
    - [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
      - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
      - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
    - [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/download/)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
      - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.2. 

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run code virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

Once the codespace opens (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):


2. **Learn Everything on Azure AI**: Familiarize yourself with Azure AI services by exploring Microsoft Learn modules, skilling videos, and training resources.
3. **Join the Hackathon**: Participate in hands-on sessions, workshops, and real-time coaching led by Microsoft experts. Collaborate with professionals and create impactful solutions.
