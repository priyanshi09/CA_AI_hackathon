# Welcome to Track 1: GenAI Powered Chatbots for Government
  
Welcome to Track 1 of our AI journey! In this track, we will delve into the exciting world of AI RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), also known as chat-with-your-data, specifically tailored for government applications. Our primary tool for this exploration will be the AI Foundry on the Azure portal.
  
## Overview  
  
In this track, you will:  
- Set up your environment on the Azure portal.  
- Learn how to leverage Vision AI, Audio AI, and Video AI for various applications.  
  
## Setting Up Your Environment  
  
To get started, we would need to set up environment on Azure and will follow the step-by-step process provided in this guide: [Chat with your data using Azure OpenAI models (AI Foundry)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?tabs=keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=ai-foundry-portal).  
  
## High-Level Overview  
  
You will gain a high-level understanding of how to utilize AI technologies leveraging your own datasets. This includes setting up integrated vectorization for enhanced search capabilities and applying these tools to real-world government scenarios.
